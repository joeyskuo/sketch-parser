sketchdatascripts


Script written to go through over 50 ndjson files, get the first 5+ json objects in each, reformat the data, and append the json object into a new file. Output file then consists of 5+ unique sketches for each of the 50 different categories. Data is then used in a REST API where the response of a get request is a random json object.
